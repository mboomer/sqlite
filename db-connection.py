# sqlite3 â€“ the Python library we will be using to connect to the database.

# open a database connection

# the cursor object is used to interact with the DB and execute queries

# run a query
# this is vulnerable to SQL Injection attack
# result_set = cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM Track')

# select all rows where composer is Miles Davis
# use the cursor object to sanitize the input to prevent an attack
# must be specified in tuple, thats what the extra comma indicates

# note this prints first 2 rows in result set and then loop continues at 3rd row
print('# ---------------------------------- #')

#cursor will execute the query and store results in the result set

for row in result_set:
    print (row)       # prints all columns in all rows

# close the cursor
# once closed, a cursor object cannot be used again. We have to get a new cursor from the connection
cursor.close() 

# close the database connection
# this is to tell the database that we are done working with it and it can release any memory and resources associated with this connection.
